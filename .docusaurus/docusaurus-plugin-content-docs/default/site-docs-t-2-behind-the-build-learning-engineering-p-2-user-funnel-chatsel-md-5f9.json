  "description": "Here we provide a step-by-step framework that illustrates the journey of teachers from the initial point of awareness about ChatSEL to the final impact on student outcomes. It helps track user behaviors, identify drop-off points, and optimize engagement strategies. For ChatSEL, which operates in low-resource settings, the funnel ensures teachers are effectively onboarded, engaged, and supported to achieve meaningful classroom outcomes.",
