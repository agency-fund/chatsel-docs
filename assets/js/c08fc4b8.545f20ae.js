Each Kernel is designed to target a specific skill or competency, such as emotion knowledge, perspective-taking, or conflict resolution. Kernels take 5-15 minutes to implement and can be taught quickly by classroom teachers or other adults. Kernels are stand-alone strategies; they do not require extensive training or preparation to use, and they do not follow a predetermined scope and sequence. Teachers choose the Kernels that work best for their own students and classroom needs and can make adaptations to increase both their relevance and ease/difficulty level over time. Teachers can integrate concepts from literacy, numeracy, and other subject areas \u2013 as well as from everyday life events \u2013 into Kernels in order to build academic skills alongside social and emotional skills.
