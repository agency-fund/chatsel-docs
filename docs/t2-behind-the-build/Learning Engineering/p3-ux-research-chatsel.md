  <summary>ChatSEL x Enseña por Colombia </summary>

---
## Goals and Objectives:

The studies aim to assess the usability, relevance, and potential impact of ChatSEL as a tool to help teachers deliver SEL activities in diverse Colombian classrooms, while advancing the broader missions of both organizations.

### Objective 1:
Explore how to embed Enseña por Colombia’s SEL curriculum and existing activities into ChatSEL to enhance its relevance and usefulness for teachers.

Activities: Review Enseña por Colombia’s SEL framework and activity library; identify areas of alignment with ChatSEL’s current content; collaboratively design and pilot integration strategies that reflect local pedagogical goals and cultural context.

Target completion: June 30, 2025

### Objective 2:
Conduct individual usability tests to assess ChatSEL’s accessibility, ease of use, and alignment with approximately 15 teachers’ instructional goals for SEL.

Activities: 30-minute sessions (in-person or virtual) where teachers complete guided tasks, such as starting chatbot conversations, requesting SEL activities based on grade level or learning goals, and exploring cultural adaptation features.

Target completion: June 30, 2025

### Objective 3:
Facilitate small focus groups to gather qualitative feedback from teachers on the usefulness of ChatSEL in helping them implement SEL in their classrooms.

Activities: Focus groups with approximately 15 teachers exploring perceptions of AI tools, SEL priorities, and expectations or concerns regarding ChatSEL integration into teaching practices.

Target completion: June 30, 2025

### Objective 4:
Examine which ChatSEL features most effectively promote teacher engagement through on-platform A/B tests. 

About 60 teachers, randomly selected from the Enseña por Colombia network, will use ChatSEL via WhatsApp over periods of 4 weeks. They will be randomly assigned to different chatbot variants through various testing phases. Key features to be tested include, but are not limited to: (1) onboarding flow (short demo vs. longer orientation), (2) daily nudge messages (present vs. absent), (3) structured vs. open-ended reflection prompts, and (4) delivery format (voice vs. text).

Outcomes will include behavioral engagement metrics (e.g., message response rates, kernel requests, activity completion, retention) and feedback from brief in-app surveys. The goal is to determine which constellation of features and engagement strategies best support sustained ChatSEL use in low-resource classrooms.

Target completion: First completed A/B test expected by August 31, 2025; Multiple A/B tests expected throughout the year until the academic year concludes in November 2025
