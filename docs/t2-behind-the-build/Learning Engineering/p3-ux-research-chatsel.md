## Usability Testing Plan

### Test Objective
To evaluate the usability and helpfulness of a WhatsApp-based social emotional learning (SEL) AI chatbot – **ChatSEL**, aimed at providing training on brief SEL games (SEL kernels developed by the Harvard EASEL Lab) to 30 Indian teachers teaching K-8 grades in government schools in Tripura.

The testing phase includes two stages:
1. **Stage 1:** A human facilitator trained by Labhya and the Agency Fund team will conduct one 30-minute in-person usability test with each teacher.
2. **Stage 2:** All teachers will interact freely with the chatbot for two weeks, conduct activities with students as suggested by the chatbot, and provide feedback via surveys.

### Testing Tasks

#### Stage 1:
- **Introduction by Facilitator:**
  > “ChatSEL is a tool designed to train and support teachers in using social and emotional learning games. These games are developed by scientists, and the activities are simple, adaptable, and help students develop critical social-emotional and executive function skills. They can develop children’s focus, memory, and self-regulation​​. By testing this tool, you’ll help refine the product and contribute to the evaluation of its effectiveness and cultural relevance. You will also gain practical strategies to enhance your students’ experience in class.”


- **Assigned Tasks:**
  1. Access and initiate a conversation with the chatbot on WhatsApp using a keyword.
  2. Navigate through the introductory flow.
  3. Ask two child-related questions faced in classrooms.
  4. Request activity ideas for specific grades (e.g., Grade 5).
  5. Request an activity based on a specific goal (e.g., increase attention).
  6. Request a cultural adaptation for an activity.
  7. Role-play with the chatbot.
  8. Save/bookmark an activity.
  9. Provide feedback on an activity.
  10. Report an issue with a suggestion.
  11. Explore help/FAQ features.
  12. Respond to daily notifications (optional).
  13. Complete a feedback survey.

#### Stage 2:
After completing Stage 1 training, teachers are instructed to use the chatbot daily for two weeks. They are encouraged to implement as many chatbot-suggested activities as possible with their students, with a minimum expectation of three activities per week. Teachers should interact with the chatbot during non-class hours to prepare brief lesson plans based on its instructions. 

When implementing the activities, teachers are expected to follow the 3-step rule below:

- In step 1, introduce the target skill for the activity. By introducing the skill, you make the skill explicit, an essential component to building skills of all kinds.
- In step 2, complete the activity with your students to practice using the skill. You can find strategies to adapt the activity through interactions with the chatbot.
- In step 3, children reflect on the skills practiced during step 2. During the reflection questions, talk with students about how hard or easy it was to play and why, which strategies they used to play, and how they might use the skill in other parts of their lives. Through reflection, students are practicing metacognitive strategies and are learning to apply the skill in new ways.

Following each in-class activity, teachers are expected to complete a short feedback survey on WhatsApp during their non-class time. The survey will capture their experiences using the chatbot as a teaching tool, including its usability and effectiveness in facilitating classroom activities.

### Script for Testing (Stage 1 Only)

**Introduction:**
> "Thank you for participating in our usability test for the Social and Emotional Learning AI Chatbot on WhatsApp. In today’s session, we will give you a few tasks to familiarize you with the chatbot and observe how you interact with it in about 30 minutes. Afterward, we will ask for your feedback on its usability and effectiveness based on your experience.
Over the next two weeks, you will freely interact with the chatbot to discover activity and game ideas for your classroom. During this time, try as many of the suggested activities as you can, aiming for at least three per week with your students. Take some time during your non-class hours to chat with the bot and prepare simple lesson plans. After each activity, we’d love for you to share your thoughts through a quick feedback survey on WhatsApp, letting us know how the chatbot worked for you and your students.
The chatbot is designed to be simple and easy to use. Feel free to explore its features and let us know your thoughts."


**During Testing:**
- Guide teachers through the testing tasks and address questions they may have about using the chatbot.
- Document teachers’ questions and concerns; if possible, record and transcribe the session for detailed analysis.
- Follow the [**General Principles for Facilitators During Usability Testing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WfeB9jfo-1DqcoCdYmOYfg2zn0DLq9SDttDgL9f36Kk/edit?tab=t.0) when interacting with teachers

**After Testing:**
- Encourage participants to use the chatbot at their convenience during the two weeks.
- Share a support Whatsapp contact in case they encounter technical difficulties.
- Request that they document any notable experiences for discussion in the feedback survey.
