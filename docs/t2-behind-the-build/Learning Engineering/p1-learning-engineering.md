# What is Learning Engineering?

Following [the definition by Tools Competition](https://toolscompetition.org/what-is-learning-engineering-and-why-does-it-matter/), we define learning engineering for ChatSEL as the use of data and engineering science and AI technology to pursue rapid experimentation and continuous improvement with the goal of improving teacher and student outcomes.


> Learning engineering, at its core, is really about three processes: 
>    - systematically collecting data as users interact with a platform, tool, or procedure while protecting user privacy 
>    - analyzing the collected data to make more educated guesses about whatâ€™s leading to better learning, and 
>    - iterating based on these data to improve the platform, tool, or procedure for better learning outcomes.
