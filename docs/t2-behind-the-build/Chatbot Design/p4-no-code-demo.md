## A hands-on no-code option for product managers

This is a basic no-code demo of ChatSEL, built using visual editors from [Glific](https://glific.org). It features a combination of static questions and responses, AI-generated conversations, and a menu with example modulesâ€”including a role-play module where teachers and AI can simulate SEL kernel interactions. The AI conversations are powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o, supported via the Assistant API (see this post from [Glific](https://glific.org/chatgpt-unleashed-journey-to-production-and-preparing-for-launch-on-glific/)).

:::tip
We highly recommend that product managers developing new GenAI chatbots get hands-on experience by building an MVP using the no-code option. 

This approach will provide valuable insights into defining the static and dynamic components of the chats, identifying common challenges in AI interactions (e.g., latency, response length, usefulness, accuracy, and relevance), and generating ideas for feature enhancements.
