## SEL kernels
Developed by Harvard University’s Ecological Approaches to Social Emotional Learning (EASEL) Laboratory, [**SEL kernels™**](https://ggie.berkeley.edu/student-well-being/sel-kernels/) are specific activities or strategies that are commonly used by research-based programs to support the growth and development of social and emotional skills and competencies.

Kernels have been developed for grades K-6 and include a variety of activity types and instructional methods, such as games, routines, and storytelling. Each kernel includes adaptations and extension activities, as well as grade level differentiations when applicable.

Drawing from EASEL’s content analysis of 25 leading SEL programs, kernels have been categorized into the following constructs: **cognitive, emotional, interpersonal, character, and mindset**.


## Brain Games
[**Brain Games**](https://ggie.berkeley.edu/practice/brain-games-a-set-of-sel-kernels-practices/#tab__1) are another set of SEL kernel practices that help students practice and build **executive function skills** in whole-class games.

Drawn from [SECURe](https://easel.gse.harvard.edu/secure), a comprehensive school-based intervention in social-emotional learning, Brain Games is comprised of 31 games that can be easily integrated into daily routines and transitions. The games are split into three “Brain Power” skills (e.g., **working memory, attention, and mental flexibility**) and help children learn how to listen carefully, use self-control, think flexibly, and remember and follow directions. After playing the games, teachers and students enage in discussions to build meta-cognition and shared vocabulary around the skills. Teachers and students also think together about how to use these skills in other times of the day – connecting “Brain Powers” to work ethic in the classroom, teamwork and building relationships with others, and successful behavior in school and beyond.
