## SEL kernels
Developed by Harvard University’s Ecological Approaches to Social Emotional Learning (EASEL) Laboratory, [**SEL kernels™**](https://selkernels.gse.harvard.edu/en-US/about) are specific activities or strategies that are commonly used by research-based programs to support the growth and development of social and emotional skills and competencies.

SEL Kernels are short, flexible, easy-to-use strategies and routines that build social and emotional skills. Each Kernel is designed to target a specific skill or competency, such as emotion knowledge, perspective-taking, or conflict resolution. Kernels take 5-15 minutes to implement and can be taught quickly by classroom teachers or other adults. Kernels are stand-alone strategies; they do not require extensive training or preparation to use, and they do not follow a predetermined scope and sequence. Teachers choose the Kernels that work best for their own students and classroom needs and can make adaptations to increase both their relevance and ease/difficulty level over time. Teachers can integrate concepts from literacy, numeracy, and other subject areas – as well as from everyday life events – into Kernels in order to build academic skills alongside social and emotional skills. Kernels are designed to be low-cost and require few to no materials, making them ideal for low-resource, turbulent environments.
