**Objective**: To help organizations conduct user research to better understand user behaviors, pain points, and motivations, ensuring that products are designed to meet real user needs. By gathering insights through research, teams can make data-driven decisions, refine user experiences, and enhance overall product engagement. This process enables organizations to build more intuitive, user-centric solutions that drive engagement, adoption, and behavioral changes.

**Tool**: A refined playbook based on:

**Tool Readiness**: 50% 

**Examples**: 
- [Qualitative usability research plan - ChatSEL & Labhya](/docs/t2-behind-the-build/Learning%20Engineering/p3-ux-research-chatsel.md)
