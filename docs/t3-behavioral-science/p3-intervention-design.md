:::warning

This page is under development...

:::

**Objective**: To guide organizations in developing intervention and product design plans informed by behavioral science and psychological research. By leveraging psychological insights into human behavior, cognition, and motivation, we hope organizations can build interventions and/or products that wisely and accurately address users’ various psychological needs.

**Tool**: A refined (and perhaps simplified) playbook based on:

⭐ Navigation Flowchart by Patricia Andrews Fearon *(tool available upon request)*

⭐ Idea implementation tools by Zezhen (Michael) Wu *(tool available upon request)*

**Tool Readiness**: 75% 

**Examples**: To be developed...

**Expected outputs from grantees**:
- A document that discusses the organization’s thinking process following our playbook, based on their user research plans and results
