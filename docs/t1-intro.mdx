## What is ChatSEL?  
ChatSEL is a **generative AI chatbot** that provides teachers with **interactive, bite-sized SEL lessons** known as SEL kernels. Built for low-resource contexts, it aims to simplify teacher training, reduce classroom burdens, and enhance childrenâ€™s social-emotional development.  

## Why ChatSEL?  
In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), teachers often face challenges such as:  
- Limited time and financial resources for training.  
- Overburdened responsibilities that hinder program implementation.  

ChatSEL addresses these barriers by delivering **flexible, culturally adaptable SEL activities** directly to teachers through WhatsApp, a widely accessible platform.

## How Does It Work?  

ChatSEL is a generative AI-powered chatbot designed to support teachers in low-resource and low-income settings by delivering evidence-based, culturally relevant Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) kernels through bite-sized and flexible classroom activities. Operating through WhatsApp via the Turn.io platform, ChatSEL integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to provide training to teachers on SEL kernels. Its key features include:

- **Interactive Activity Learning**:  ChatSEL suggests SEL activities tailored to classroom contexts and provides guided, step-by-step implementation support. Teachers who are unfamiliar with the SEL curriculum can role-play activities with ChatSEL and practice their skills in delivering the activities in the actual classroom.
- **Feedback-Driven Learning**: ChatSEL collects daily teacher data and feedback and adjusts its recommendations for future activities. This adaptive learning ensures variety and context-relevance of the SEL implementation.
- **Real-Time Translation and Voice Interaction**: ChatSEL translates activity instructions into local languages and supports voice input tailored to diverse cultural settings.
- **Culturally Relevant Adaptation**: ChatSEL offers real-time tips for adapting activities to fit cultural contexts, based on NGO-provided guidelines and adaptation framework developed by the EASEL Lab and the Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies.
- **General Developmental Guidance**: ChatSEL also provides general advice on child development and SEL. Teachers can ask questions about specific classroom challenges, and ChatSEL will offer both targeted interventions and broader recommendations.


The chatbotâ€™s knowledge base draws from evidence-based [SEL kernels](https://selkernels.gse.harvard.edu/en-US) developed by **Dr. Stephanie Jones** at the Harvard EASEL Lab.

## Who is Behind ChatSEL?  
ChatSEL is a collaboration between [**The Agency Fund**](https://www.agency.fund/) and the [**Harvard EASEL Lab**](https://easel.gse.harvard.edu/). It is supported by a multidisciplinary team of behavioral scientists, software engineers, and educators with a shared mission to empower teachers and improve childrenâ€™s SEL outcomes.

We are also partnering with [**the Labhya Foundation**](https://www.labhya.org/) to design and pilot ChatSEL for teachers in Tripura, India.
